This guide will show you how to easily get started with using PayPal with Jexactyl
in order to process credit purchases.

or newer in order to use the PayPal system.

### Obtain Client ID and Client Secret

You'll need to firstly create a new 'App' with PayPal in order to get a Client ID and secret
for use with Jexactyl.

### 5. Add Client ID and Secret to Jexactyl
Next, you'll need to place these keys in your `.env` file in order to allow Jexactyl to login.

```bash
cd /var/www/jexactyl
nano .env

# Fill in the fields PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID and PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET
```

### 6. Enable the PayPal gateway in settings

?> Make sure the 'PayPal enabled' setting is set to `Enabled`.

### 7. Test your configuration

Head over to the Jexactyl Storefront and click the 'Balance' tab. Once you're there, attempt to buy `x` credits with PayPal.
If the page redirects to a PayPal purchase portal, congrats! You've successfully set up and configured PayPal.

?> If you run into a Unable to process order error while trying to buy credits, enable Live Mode in the PayPal dashboard. If you still run into issues while getting started with PayPal, let us know in the [Jexactyl Discord](https://discord.com/invite/qttGR4Z5Pk)
