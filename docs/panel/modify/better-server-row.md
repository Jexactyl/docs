# Improving Server Row
***
In this example, we'll show you how to add elements to the ServerRow element
in order to add more metrics and data to your Panel. This is a simple and 
quick process which allows for you to display more info at a glance.

## Find ServerRow.tsx file
The file we'll be editing in this example is called ServerRow.tsx.
This file is what displays all available servers via the user UI,
and is what we will be editing. The file path for ServerRow.tsx is:
```bash
/resources/scripts/components/dashboard/ServerRow.tsx
```
:::info 
This is best done in a code edior like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
You can upload your Panel files to a GitHub repository, clone them to your PC and edit them
from there!
:::

After you've navigated to the file and opened it, you can then start by making sure
no errors pop up in your IDE's console. If they do, it's most likely due to your
Yarn depedencies not being installed on your local machine - simply installing NodeJS, 
NPM and Yarn along with running `yarn install` will fix that problem for you.

Once you've verified everything is good to go, it's time to make some changes 
to this file.
